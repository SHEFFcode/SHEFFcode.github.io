When I am not programming, I spend time with the people I love. As a new father this usually means my son and my wife. I enjoy running, tennis and biking. 

I learn the timeless Jewish wisdom of Mishnah and Talmud at a Kollel with my study partners.

I have have traveled extensively around Asia. I hope to add Latin America and Australia to this list soon.
